# Portfolio
My name is Nolan Beck; I'm an Accounting major (Data Analytics Track) at DeSales University expecting to graduate in May of 2022.  This repository is a compilation of various projects, reports, and other studies which display my experience in different softwares and coding languages.
Beginning in the fall of 2022, I will begin working at Ernst & Young as an Associate Tax Accountant.  I hope to become a licensed CPA in order to bolster my professional credibility.
I plan on honing my competencies with the softwares and coding languages included in this portfolio while also learning new ones.  In the long term, I would like to leverage these skills in my role as an accountant, with the potential working in a more data analytics-oriented role in the future.
